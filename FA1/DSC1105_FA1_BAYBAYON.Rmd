```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.align = "center", fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 5, out.width = "5in")
```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)

##### ECDF plot for GranzymeB

```{r}
granzymeB <- dataset$GranzymeB
ggplot(dataset, aes(x = granzymeB)) + stat_ecdf() + xlab("GranzymeB") + ylab("percent")
```


This plot shows a slow increase at lower values, sharp rise in the middle. This means that most of the values in this column are concentrated in the middle and less extreme lower values.

##### Histogram plot for GranzymeB

```{r}
ggplot(dataset, aes(x = granzymeB)) +geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + 
  xlab("GranzymeB") + ylab("percent")

```

The histogram for granzymeB is skewed to the left which means that most of the values in this column are large and there are less lower values.

##### Q-Q plot for CD2 and CD4

```{r}
cd2 <- dataset$CD2
cd4 <- dataset$CD4


qqplot(cd2, cd4,  main = "CD2 vs. CD4") 
```

This plot deviates significantly from a straight diagonal line which implies that the quantiles do not have a similar distribution.Towards the right, CD4 values increase sharply compared to CD2 which suggests that it is more skewed to the right.
